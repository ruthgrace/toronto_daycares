# toronto_daycares

This website embeds https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/children-parenting/children-programs-activities/licensed-child-care/child-care-locator/#location=&lat=&lng=&zoom=

the toronto.ca website lets people search for daycares or preschools, and then we allow people to add schools to their interested lists, and rearrange the order

Later we will add ability to add timestamped notes, see notes history, and mark waitlist vs accepted status
